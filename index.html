    <p>My name is Areeba Shaikh and I’m a digital designer based in the Waterloo Region.
    I am currently studying Global Business and Digital Arts at the University of Waterloo, where my degree has a central focus on digital design.
    <br>
    My interest in graphic design began when I was appointed to be one of two co-presidents of the Arts Council at Cameron Heights C.I., where a majority of my role consisted of social media work and coordinating events.
    As such, I was able to develop my skills in adobe creative suite, canva and marketing skills, as well as connect with others who had like-minded interests. 
    Furthermore, this helped me flourish within the business community as I was able to learn crucial networking skills through the events I planned and through the people I connected with.
    This encouraged me to pursue a degree I am both passionate about and will continue to be challenged by, business and design.</p>

    <p>Designing a streaming app taught me how to balance both looks and usability.
    It's not just about making something aestheticallly pleasing, but also guiding users smoothly through the content.
    Keeping things simple yet feature-packed is key, and collaboration is crucial for improvement.
    Overall, I've learned the art of blending creativity with functionality in creating an enjoyable and efficient user experience.</p>

    <p>We started this journey by identifying the key issues that plagued many existing cooking apps.
    Users often complained about complicated user interfaces, ineffective search functionality, limited customization options, and inconsistent recipe quality.
    It was clear that there was a need for a cooking app that simplifies the user experience and enhances the joy of cooking.
    <br>
    But we didn't stop there! We wanted to go a step further and create a sense of community, a place where food enthusiasts can connect, inspire, and share their culinary journeys.
    Our app includes a vibrant community aspect, allowing users to follow each other, keep up with their favorite recipes, and leave comments to foster a collaborative cooking environment.</p>
  
    <p style="font-style: italic">“Flavour Sphere is the ultimate social media hub for food enthusiasts, home cooks, and professional chefs alike.
    Unleash your creativity in the kitchen and share your gastronomic adventures with a community that speaks your culinary language.
    Whether you're a novice seeking inspiration or a seasoned pro looking to showcase your masterpieces, Flavour Sphere is your virtual kitchen companion.”</p>

    <p>This section is dedicated to a project that began as an upcycling piece, and ended being published in a local arts magazine, Textile Magazine.
    The idea behind this piece was to use materials we already had, which in this specific case was a locker door from renovations being done at my high school, to create something new. 
    This piece is also representative of originality, as it transforms something standard into a creative piece.</p>
